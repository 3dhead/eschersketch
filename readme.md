===========

This is a program built to experiment with pattern design in the classical [wallpaper groups][1].

It allows one to paint and layout repeating patterns in real-time.

This version has been completely rewritten in ES6 Javascript and Vue.

It features SVG export as well as PNG.

Designers should be sure to check out the illustrator template package from [madpattern][2].


### Future
- Add reflection/rotation rosettes to the UI
- add spherical and hyperbolic representations?
- maybe rewrite using paper.js
