===========

This is a project built to experiment with pattern design in the classical [wallpaper groups][1]. It allows one to prototype tiling designs in HTML5 Canvas.

This is currently a bare bones alpha version that allows one to paint in any of the 17 wallpaper groups.

It is written in coffeescript.

### Future
- Add basic rosettes, and other symmetrical operations
- streamline rendering engine
- undo/redo stack
