===========

This is a program built to experiment with pattern design in the classical [wallpaper groups][1] and
rosette [point groups][2].  It allows the user to draw and layout repeating patterns in real-time.

This version has been completely rewritten in ES6 Javascript and Vue.  It works reasonably well with mobile
and desktop browsers.  Undo/Redo and basic vector graphic primitives are now supported.

It features SVG export as well as PNG.  It also exports high-res PNG "tiles" that are suitable for use with tools
like Photoshop pattern fill, graphics textures, or upload to services such as Spoonflower to be used in printed
patterns.
